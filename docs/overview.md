# Solar Imaging with Halpha

## Overview of HAlpha 
Welcome to the HAlpha project, a small project designed to capture and enhance images of the sun using a Raspberry Pi, a small telescope and an astro fotography camera. 

## What is HAlpha?
HAlpha is a system that leverages the PMOD-WRC platform, located in Davos. PMOD-WRC platform is an automated solar tracking and measurement plattform. HAlpha is mounted on the WSG plattform thus every  time measurements are done with the plattform HAlpha can take fotos of the sun and stream them onto our webpage. These photos are then processed through some image processing algorythms to improve image quality.

The project utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 as the central computing unit, connecting to a QHYCCD camera via USB.

## Who is this page for?
This page is mainly for the maintainers of this project in Davos. If you want to replicate the project yourself youre free to do it. We use an MIT licsense. Have fun.
